      <section>
        <p>Thank you for using Tabs to Nap. Your privacy is very important to us. This policy explains what information the extension handles and why.</p>
        <h3>1. The Golden Rule: We Do Not Collect Personal Data</h3>
        <p>Tabs to Nap is designed with privacy as a core principle. The extension does not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal or browsing information to our servers or any third-party servers.</p>
        <p>All of the extension's logic and operations occur exclusively on your computer (locally).</p>
        <h3>2. Information Used by the Extension (Locally)</h3>
        <p>To function correctly, the extension needs to access certain information from your browser, but this information never leaves your machine:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tab URLs and Titles:</strong> The extension needs to know a tab's address (URL) and title to suspend and restore it correctly. This information is temporarily stored on the suspension page and is discarded when the tab is restored.</li>
          <li><strong>User Settings:</strong> Your preferences, such as the automatic suspension time and the list of websites that should not be suspended (the "whitelist"), are saved using Chrome's Storage API (chrome.storage.local). This data is stored only in your browser profile, and we do not have access to it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Extension Permissions and Their Justification</h3>
        <p>We request the following permissions in your browser, and we want to be completely transparent about why we need them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>tabs</code>: To be able to suspend and restore your tabs.</li>
          <li><code>storage</code>: To save your personal settings (suspension time and whitelist) only on your computer.</li>
          <li><code>alarms</code>: To allow the automatic suspension timer to work.</li>
          <li><code>contextMenus</code>: To provide you with suspension options in the right-click menu.</li>
          <li><code>host_permissions</code>: To allow the extension to work on any page you visit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>If we update this policy in the future, we will inform you through the release notes on the Chrome Web Store.</p>
        <h3>5. Contact</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us.</p>
